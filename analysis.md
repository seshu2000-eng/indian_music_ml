   - Mix of Tamil music composers and international artists

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- Extracted track metadata: name, album, artist, release date, length, popularity
- Implemented pagination for large datasets (artist albums)
- Added rate limiting (0.3s delay between API calls)

### Data Storage
- Exported playlist data to CSV format for further analysis
- Structured data with clear column naming conventions

## Insights and Observations

1. **Popularity Distribution**: The playlist shows a bimodal distribution with very popular international hits and less popular regional content

2. **Artist Dominance**: Yuvan Shankar Raja has the most tracks in the playlist, reflecting his significant contribution to Tamil cinema music

3. **Temporal Trends**: Newer releases generally have higher popularity scores

4. **Genre Mix**: The playlist blends traditional Tamil film music with contemporary international pop

## Potential Applications

1. **Music Recommendation**: Understanding popularity patterns can inform recommendation algorithms
2. **Artist Analytics**: Track performance metrics for artists and composers
3. **Playlist Curation**: Data-driven insights for creating balanced playlists
4. **Market Analysis**: Understanding regional music preferences and international crossover appeal

## Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**: Required careful pacing of requests
2. **Data Completeness**: Some audio features were not extracted in this analysis
3. **Sample Size**: Limited to 100 tracks from one playlist
4. **Regional Bias**: Focused primarily on Tamil music market

## Future Enhancements

1. Extract audio features (danceability, energy, acousticness, etc.)
2. Analyze temporal trends in music characteristics
3. Compare multiple playlists/genres
4. Implement predictive modeling for track popularity
5. Add sentiment analysis of lyrics (if available)

This analysis demonstrates the power of Spotify's API for music analytics and provides valuable insights into the characteristics of popular music in the Tamil market and beyond.
